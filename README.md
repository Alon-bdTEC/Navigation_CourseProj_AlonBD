# 🤖 Robot Navigation in an Apartment using A* Search (MATLAB)

![Robot Room Scheme](Robot_Room_Scheme.JPG)

## 🧭 Overview
This project explores the use of the **A\*** search algorithm in MATLAB to navigate a robot through an apartment layout.  
Two cases were tested:

1. **Rectangular robot (offline A\*)** – full knowledge of the environment.  
2. **Disk robot (online A\*)** – discovers the environment while moving.

The goal was to compare how A\* behaves when used for **online navigation**, revealing its weaknesses when the map is not known in advance.

## ⚙️ What Was Done
- Implemented the **A\*** algorithm for path planning in MATLAB.  
- Modeled the apartment as a 2D grid map (walls = obstacles).  
- Used the same **Start** and **Goal** for both robot types.  
- Ran simulations measuring path length, iterations, and computation time.

## 📊 Key Findings
| Scenario | Robot Type | Knowledge | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Offline A* | Rectangular | Full map | Fast & efficient – under 100 iterations done in seconds |
| Online A* | Disk | Partial (online) | Very slow – 10,000+ iterations, poor response

Even with adjustments, **A\*** performs badly online because it re-plans from scratch whenever new obstacles appear.  
It’s optimal for **offline path planning**, but **not suitable for online or dynamic navigation**.

## 🧠 Insights
The A\* cost function is  
f(n) = g(n) + h(n),  
where g(n) is the path cost so far and h(n) is a heuristic estimate to the goal.  
In online mode, h(n) constantly becomes outdated, forcing repeated recalculations and wasted iterations.
